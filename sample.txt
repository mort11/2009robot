FRC Sample Simple C Template
--------------------------------

This is a minimal C program that demonstrates how to get a robot running
using the C API to the WPI Robotics Library. The C functions wrap the C++
classes and methods. This must be created as a .cpp file since there are
overloaded functions to make the set of functions smaller.
